.ptcs (polytrode clustered spikes) files
version 1

Stick to 8 byte alignment for consistency and easy reading by eye in hex editor. Some fields are floats, most are ints.

File desctription field might contain: the string ".ptcs (polytrode clustered spikes) file", date/time of clustering/extraction, clustering methods used, recordings/tracks that were clustered, polytrode type(s), etc.

Neuron description field might contain: which polytrode/brain area the neuron was recorded from for multi polytrode recordings, neuron type (FS, RS, etc.)

file header:
-------------------
formatversion: int64 (start at version 1)
nfiledescrbytes: uint64 (nbytes, keep as multiple of 8 for nice alignment)
filedescr: nfiledescrbytes of ASCII text
    (padded with spaces if needed for 8 byte alignment)
nneurons: uint64 (number of neurons)
nspikes: uint64 (total number of spikes)
nsamplebytes: uint64 (number of bytes per template waveform sample)
uVperAD: float64 (converts AD sample units to uV)
samplerate: float64 (Hz)

neuron i:
-------------------
nid: int64 (signed neuron id, could be -ve, could be non-contiguous with previous)
ptid: int64 (polytrode/tetrode/electrode ID, for multi electrode recordings)
nneurondescrbytes: uint64 (nbytes, keep as multiple of 8 for nice alignment,
                           defaults to 0)
neurondescr: nneurondescrbytes of ASCII text
clusterscore: float64
xpos: float64 (um)
ypos: float64 (um)
zpos: float64 (um) (defaults to NaN)
nchans: uint64 (num chans in template waveforms)
chans: nchans * uint64 (IDs of channels in template waveforms)
maxchan: uint64 (ID of max channel in template waveforms)
nt: uint64 (num timepoints per template waveform channel)
nwaveformbytes: uint64 (nbytes, keep as multiple of 8 for nice alignment)
waveforms: nchans * nt * nsamplebytes
    (float AD template waveform data, padded with zeros if
     needed for 8 byte alignment)
nspikes: uint64 (number of spikes in this neuron)
spike timestamps: nspikes * uint64 (us, should be sorted)
