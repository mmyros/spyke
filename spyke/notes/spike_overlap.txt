for ptc15.87:

chans: 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32
template is at: 24780: 24280 to 25260
tempalte overlapped with something is at 41280: 40800 to 41760

# plot the difference:
wave1 = self.hpstream[24780+self.spiketw[0] : 24780+self.spiketw[1]]
wave2 = self.hpstream[41280+self.spiketw[0] : 41280+self.spiketw[1]]
self.frames['spike'].panel.plot(wave2-wave1, 41280)

# difference doesn't look like any other spike in the file, that I can see. Tried a bunch of different offsets, didn't help
