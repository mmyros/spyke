- interpolation

- have a log window at bottom that details everything going on behind the scenes
    - this could simply be an integrated pyshell window, so you can do things from command line instead of being forced to use interface
    - also, use it to examine and mess with internals, including wxpy internals

- make spyke importable as a library, not just as a standalone program. This way, you can parse files, spike sort, etc directly from interpreter, or neuropy.

- need to look into just how complex and slow the (automated) sorting will be
    - can it all be done in pure Python?
    - start with manual template definition

- how hard will it be to generate highpass, lowpass, chartwindow, and fistogram widgets in wxpython?
    - email wxpython list on displaying time series data.
    - wxpy 2.8 should be faster, doesn't need to copy data
    - borrow something from MPL?

- spike (and lfp?) data need to be corrected for S+H delay offsets. Do this during interpolation as in Surfbawd?

- lfp data need to be corrected for offsets induced by low-pass filters
    - what are the spectral phase and amplitude characteristics of the filters?
    - Tim mentioned Hilbert transforms are useful for this
    - want to do CSDs as well - I guess these don't need to be filter offset corrected, since you're just comparing between lfp chans, not between lfp and spike chans

- questions for programmer
    - how well do you know python?
    - done any larger projects in python?
        - how many lines of code?
        - could you show it to us?
    - know anything about scipy/numpy?
    - know what it means to do things pythonically?
    - know python style guidelines?
        - spacing, capitalization, docstrings
    - used wxpython?
    - used wxGlade?
    - used/willing to learn version control (SVN)?
        - TortoiseSVN in windows

    - know any Delphi? enough to understand what Delphi code is doing?
    - have a windows machine to develop on, comfortable doing so?
        - conscious of trying to keep it cross-platform
    - dev in python 2.4, wxpy 2.6 (or 2.8? can reuse numpy data w/o copy?), latest numpy/scipy
