spyke is a Python package for visualizing, navigating, and spike sorting
extracellular waveform data. It currently works with Swindale Lab
(http://swindale.ecc.ubc.ca) .srf files. Some of its functionality was
inherited from Tim Blanche's Delphi program "SurfBawd".

Some icons were copied from Ubuntu's Humanity icon theme:

Dependencies:

spyke requires recent versions of the following to be installed:

Python (2.7.x, 3.x hasn't been tested)
IPython 1.0.dev
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
PyQt4 (PySide will probably work, but is untested)
PyOpenGL
Cython

spyke is developed in Xubuntu 12.10. It should work in other Linux distributions.
In principle, it should also work in Windows and OSX.

To run:

$ python main.py # in the spyke folder

To install for use as a library:

$ python setup.py install

To develop:

$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Many keyboard shortcuts are available. Tooltips give some hints. You can also
discover them by searching for "keyPressEvent" methods in the code.
