spyke is a Python package for visualization, navigation, and spike sorting of extracellular waveform data, and currently works with Swindale Lab .srf files. Some of its functionality is inherited from Tim Blanche's Delphi program "SurfBawd".

To install:

>>> python setup.py install

To develop:

>>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Launch the program by running spyke/main.py

For clustering, you need to use keyboard commands. Take a look in cluster.SpykeMayaviScene.OnKeyDown to see what various keys do what.
