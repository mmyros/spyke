spyke is a Python package for visualization, navigation, and spike sorting of extracellular
waveform data, and currently works with Swindale Lab .srf files. Some of its functionality
was inherited from Tim Blanche's Delphi program "SurfBawd".

Some icons were copied from Ubuntu's Humanity icon theme: http://launchpad.net/humanity

To install:

>>> python setup.py install

To develop:

>>> python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Launch the program by running:

>>> python main.py

in the "spyke" directory.

Many keyboard shortcuts are available. Tooltips give some hints. You can also discover them
by searching for "keyPressEvent" methods in the code.
